The current state of the ZPU:

- Patches welcome!
- Zylin is rummaging up the various files that might be of interest
  to the open source ZPU project. 
- The ZPU, GCC toolchain and HDL works. Zylin eCosBoard 1.1 ships w/a 
  ZPU(see http://www.zylin.com), if you need a development board before 
  implementing on your own system.
- The docs leave a lot to be desired at this point.
- Licensing needs to be ironed out. After which lots of files will have
  to be updated, strictly speaking. Patches welcome!
