Welcome to ZPUino!

1) What is ZPUino ?

ZPUino is a SoC (System-on-a-Chip) based on Zylin's ZPU 32-bit processor core.

2) What is inside ZPUino ?

Harware-wise, ZPUino currently integrates the following devices:

  * ZPU small core (slightly modified) [optional medium-core, still on the forge]
  * One UART
  * One SPI interface
  * Two 16-bit timers
  * One TSC (Time Stamp Counter)
  * 32-bit GPIO interface
  * Interrupt Controller
  * One SigmaDelta output [NEW!]
  
UART Specifications:

 * 16-bit prescaler.
 * 16-byte deep receive FIFO

SPI Specifications:

 * Programmable prescaler.
 * Configurable CPOL.
 * Configurable SRE (Sample on Rising Edge) [NEW!]
 * 8-bit transmission mode, 4 byte (32 bit) receive register.
 
Timers Specifications:

 * 10-bit prescaler
 * 16-bit wide counter
 * Count-up and Count-down mode
 * 16-bit Compare register
 * Clear on Compare match support
 * Interrupt support on Compare Match
 * Output compare Register to GPIO pin (allows PWM) [NEW!]

Interrupt controller Specifications:

 * Up to 16 interrupt lines
 * Ensures safety (does not allow interrupt recursion)
 * 16-bit interrupt mask [NEW!]
 * Interrupt Enable bit
 
GPIO Specifications:

 * 32-bit wide (one reserved for SPI)
 * Bi-directional (tristate) configuration.

IO Configuration:

 * Blocking IO [NEW!]
 
SigmaDelta Configuration:

 * One 16-bit channel [NEW!]
 * Blocking and non-Blocking support [NEW!]

Software-wise, it supports the following features:

 * 4Kb Bootloader, which includes required emulation code for ZPU.
 * Bootstraps code from program flash (shadows into FPGA blockram)
 * Serial programming of program flash.
 * Serial reset (TODO)

3) Where does it run ?

First implementation was done on Spartan3E 500 (-4), on a S3E Starter Kit, with a M25P16 SPI flash ROM and 32Kbytes RAM.
Implemented sizes (approximate): 841 Slices ( 563 FF, 1094 LUT )
Running speed: 100MHz (50Mhz external clock + DCM)

Current implementation still runs at 100MHz.
