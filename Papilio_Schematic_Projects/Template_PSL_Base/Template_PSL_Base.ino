 Papilio Schematic Library Example
 To learn more about the Papilio Schematic Library please visit http://learn.gadgetfactory.net
 
 To get started click on the bit file link below that corresponds to the type of Papilio board you have. 
 You should see the Papilio Loader pop up and program the circuit for this example to your Papilio Board. 
 IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be sure that you are programming the bit file to SPI Flash. ZPUino will not work if written to FPGA only.
 
 Make sure you have selected the correct ZPUino board type and com port, the Papilio always uses channel B of the FT2232 so it is usually the second com port you see.
 
 You can open a PDF showing the circuit defined in the bit file by selecting the appropriate link to view the scheamtic for the type of Papilio board you have.
 
 If you want to modify the circuit then make sure you have Xilinx ISE Webpack installed and click on the appropriate link to modify the schematic below.
 If you do not have Xilinx ISE Webpack installed visit this tutorial to learn how. http://gadgetfactory.net/learn/2013/10/23/install-xilinxs-free-ise-webpack/
 
 If the links below do not work then then open the sketch directory from Sketch/Show Sketch Folder (Ctl-K) and manually access the files defined in the links below.
